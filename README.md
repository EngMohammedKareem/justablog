## NOTIFICATIONS ARE FINALLY HERE !!!!

I'm very excited and exhausted to announce that after learning more about laravel i was able to implement not only mail notifications but standard database notifications to improve the user experience i'm hoping

-   get notified when someone likes any of your posts and click on the notification to navigate to that post

-   get notified when someone leaves a new comment on one of your posts and as above, click on it to be taken to that post

-   get notified when someone starts to follow you

Check it out

## 🎉 New Features: search users by username + flash messages + new navbar look + improved menu for mobile users

I'm very excited to announce that my small side project is now shaping up very well and today i implemented new features including:

-   finding users by usernames: yes the feature is finally here and now you can connect with other people by searching their username on Justablog
-   added some flash messages for posts / commeents events like updating and deleting just cause it's a nice feature to have
-   since removing the post button from the home page i added it to the navbar and the mobile usrrs responsive menu for better user experience ( same with the users search feature )
-   slightly improved profiles now
-   fixed a seriously annoying bug that was preventing the search form from functioning properly

🚀 Key Benefits

1. Improved User Discovery: Easily find and connect with other users by searching for their usernames.
2. Enhanced Usability: Simple and intuitive search interface that enhances the user experience.
3. Faster Connections: Quickly locate users without having to navigate through posts ( terrible experience i know ).

My biggest hope is that someone is watching this project grow now and be inspired to create their own projects and enjoy the process

**contributions are always welcome as they help me learn more laravel**
